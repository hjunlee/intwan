Interface to Wannier90

# Done
 1. fully in terms of PWs (QE, VASP)
 2. exploit symmetry with SO (QE, VASP): 
 3. parallelization (QE, VASP)
 4. compatible with wannier90 2.1 (QE, VASP)
 
# TODO
 1. complete current recipes for symmetry-adapted WFs
 or adopt R. Sakuma's recipe: check wannier90 2.1
 2. automatize construction of WFs
 3. complete current recipes for WFs with GW and Hybrid
 4. Wien2k+DMFT
